This project uses multiclassification (original csv has column name rating from 1-5  but needs to be changed into label from 0-4 by subtracting 1 and renamed to label).

This project is to be done in 4 stages:


MLM pipeline consisits of 2 steps:
Step 1
1- run optuna trials until completion
2-return best model and hyperparameters

Step 2
1- train the model with the best hyperparameters with full dataset
2-validate model and return training curve for MLM accuracy




finetuning has 2 stages

Stage 1
1- run optuna trials until completion
2- return best model with hyperparameters

Stage 2
1- Train best model on full dataset (except validation set)
2 return predictions on validation set and return training curve for classification accuracy on validation set


Avoid introducing new modules, we need to focus on making current code work. We must focus on succesfully completing optuna trials.

When an error is presented, make sure to fully understand full project structure and how the proposed change will affect other parts of the code.
Always use type hinting, logging and tracebacks.

Make sure to verify that any changes proposed will not affect other parts of the code.


Do not make any additional changes other than requested. Ask permission before making any changes to both yaml.






DO NOT CHANGE WHAT SAYS DO NOT CHANGE IN YAML


request my input before you make any changes, otherwise, do not make any changes in code.

When updating code, if there are any docstrings, do not return them.
