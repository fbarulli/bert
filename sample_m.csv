1,I ordered the fall unknown off 2024 and you gave me fall 2023 and you still have not corrected the problem Horrible customer service
2,I specifically ordered the extra strength you sent me the original so I went to my order to check to see if I was charged and it said original I know for a unknown I ordered extra strength so not unknown Im very disappointed
3,The reel I eventually received does not function 100 properly I can only rotate the slides between 14 times slides sometimes do not align with the viewer and the functionality is totally unpredictable Disappointing functionality compared with my expectations
4,Your online order system needs a lot of work Unable to place multiple orders to different addresses However your customer service operator unknown was wonderful Worked past closing to straighten it out All the orders loved the sausage and cheese
5,Customer service answered all of my questions and was very helpful in taking my order and then following up with the shipping Excellent job
